					Thiru AI Labs is the solo AI systems studio of Nick Thiru, focused on building production-grade agentic micro-SaaS products and automation systems that solve real-world problems, mostly in the business domain. Rather than building generic chatbots that attempt to do everything, Thiru AI Labs develops specialized agents designed for particular use cases and audiences. <a href="https://nickthiru.dev/writing/why-building-solo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-[#fe1817] hover:underline inline-flex items-center gap-1">Why solo? →</a>

				<p>
					Combining full-stack web development, AWS/CDK infrastructure, and LangGraph-based agent workflows, Thiru AI Labs designs, builds, and operates production-grade AI systems. Every product here is built as a complete system with proper infrastructure, authentication, billing, and observability from day one.

				<p>
					This approach prioritizes production readiness, systems thinking, and real-world utility over flashy demos. Each product is built to be sustainable, scalable, and genuinely useful for its target audience.
